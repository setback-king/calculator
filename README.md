# calculator

DEMO HERE ------------> https://setback-king.github.io/calculator/

For this project, I will be creating a fully functioning calculator. I will be following parameters given to me by The Odin Project, however I will also be implementing some of my own features as well. I will update this once I am finished. 

Cheers.
